# Libraries

This is a set of libraries that have been developed over time for various work, I have done throughout my career.
I am in the process of organizing and formalizing with README files as unit tests.

Some are very opinionated, half completed, in the process of conversion, have dependencies and / or in development.
Some are ES6 modules while others have been converted to typescript.
Some of these are available via npm

If you are in need of assistance with a particular library, feel free to reach me at thxmike@gmail.com or on this github page. 
I will do my best to assist if possible.
