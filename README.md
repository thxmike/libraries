# Libraries

This is a set of libraries that have been developed over time for various work, I have done throughout my career.

Some these items are very opinionated, half completed, broken, in the process of conversion, have orphaned dependencies and / or in development.
Some are ES6 modules while others have been converted to typescript.
Some of these are available via npm

While I work on the process of fixing, organizing and formalizing these items,
If you are in need of assistance with a particular library, feel free to reach me at thxmike@gmail.com or on this github page. 
I will do my best to assist if possible.
